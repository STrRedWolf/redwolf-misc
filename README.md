Here are some miscellaneous tools that I wrote.  They're fairly self
contained.

fixffbookmark.pl
----------------

This converts a Netscape/Firefox bookmark.html file to HTML5, strips the
icons, and injects a little bit of CSS to make it usable on mobile browsers. 
Works on desktop Firefox and Chrome (all platforms) and iOS 8.1 Mobile
Safari/WebKit.
